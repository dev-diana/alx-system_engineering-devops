# Networking Basics #1
In this directory, I am exploring the different facets of localhost/127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0, /etc/hosts and how to display my machineâ€™s active network interfaces.

I use different network commands on my remote terminal such as ifconfig, telnet, nc and cut.

So enlightening learning networking in the context of debugging socket connection issues, or connecting to a software and deciphering if the issue is the software or the network, or working on firewall rules.
